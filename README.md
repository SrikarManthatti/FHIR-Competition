# Dataset
Dataset is created using the scripts in the `dataset_generator/` directory. Each script fetches objects of a particular type and then they get combined using the `combine` script.  
Running `source.py` calls all of the required function and the final dataset should be created in `dataset` directory.  


# Solutions
In the `solutions/` directory you can find answers to all questions in Python. It is not the most efficient solution but they are relatively short and understandable. They all get use of the two `read_data.py` and `data_types.py` scripts in the parent directory.  

# Marker
Your answers are marked using the `marker.py` script. It compares your output file with the correct output file.
